# Customer-Churn

In this project I will try to use Machine Learning to guess or predict customer churn from a Tele Communications company. The data set I'm using I got from kaggle.com.

I will use 6 algorithm models when training data and will compare the results of the six models and will hypertune the parameters using GridSearchCV to find the best parameters for each model and then choose the best model to use to predict churn.
